# Number Guessing Game (C++)

This project was developed as part of my C++ Internship at CodSoft.

## 📌 Description

- User input handling
- Hint system (Too High / Too Low)
- Counts number of attempts
- Loop until correct guess

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Variables and Data Types

- Loops
- Random Number Generation
- Basic Input/Output

## ▶️ How to Run

Compile:
g++ guessing_game.cpp -o game

Run:
./game

## 📌 Internship Task
